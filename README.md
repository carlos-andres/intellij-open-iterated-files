# Open the Iterated Files PhpStorm Extension

## Overview

"Open the Iterated Files" is a PhpStorm extension designed to enhance the workflow of developers working with version control systems (VCS). It provides a convenient way to quickly open all modified and new un-versioned files in the editor with a single action. This feature is particularly useful for reviewing changes before committing or adding new files to the repository.

## Features

- **Open Modified Files**: Automatically opens all files that have been modified and are tracked by the VCS.
- **Open Un-versioned Files**: Automatically opens all new files that are not yet tracked by the VCS.
- **Quick Access**: Offers a keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + Alt + Meta + O` for quick access to the feature.

## Installation

1. **Via JetBrains Marketplace**: 
   - Open PhpStorm.
   - Navigate to `Settings` > `Plugins`.
   - Click on `Marketplace` and search for "Open the Iterated Files".
   - Click `Install` and restart PhpStorm.

## Usage

After installation, the extension adds an action to PhpStorm that can be triggered via a keyboard shortcut (`Ctrl + Alt + Meta + O`) or found in the VCS groups menu. When triggered, it will open all modified and new un-versioned files in the editor tabs.

## Configuration

No additional configuration is required after installation. The action works with the project's VCS to identify modified and un-versioned files.
